R script to convert Excel to GDX

 Can replace GDXXRW for Excel-to-GDX conversion and accepts the same arguments and a subset of the options that GDXXRW does. Unlike GDXXRW, this script Works on non-Windows platforms and does not require Office.

For further information read the header comments in the script and see the [GDXXRW documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_GDXXRW.html).

## Requirements:
* [gdxrrw](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_GDXRRW.html) R package.
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) R package collection.
